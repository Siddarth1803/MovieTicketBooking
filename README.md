**Header Files and Definitions:**

#include <stdio.h>: For input and output functions.

#include <stdlib.h>: For general utility functions.

#include <string.h>: For string manipulation functions.

Defines constants for the maximum number of rows and columns (MAX_ROWS and MAX_COLS) and total seats (MAX_SEATS).

**Global Variables:**

float ticketRate: The cost of one ticket.

char bookedSeats[MAX_ROWS][MAX_COLS]: 2D array to keep track of booked seats (0 for available, 1 for booked). 

**Data Structure:**

struct UserInfo: Contains name and mobile fields to store user details.
Functions:

main(): Displays the main menu and handles user choice.
adminMenu(): Admin functions including setting ticket rate and viewing booked seats.
userMenu(): User functions including booking tickets, canceling tickets, and viewing available seats.
displaySeats(): Displays the seating layout, marking booked seats.
reserveSeats(): Allows users to book seats.
cancelSeats(): Allows users to cancel bookings.
viewAvailableSeats(): Shows seats that are available.
authenticateAdmin(): Authenticates the admin user.

**Detailed Functionality**

main():

Provides a looped menu for users to choose between admin, user, or exit.
Depending on the choice, it either authenticates the admin or presents the user menu.

adminMenu():

Allows the admin to set a new ticket rate or view booked seats.

userMenu():

Allows users to book or cancel tickets and view available seats. It also handles user information and displays booking details.

displaySeats():

Prints out the seating layout with seat numbers and marks booked seats with an asterisk.

reserveSeats():

Lets users book specific seats and marks them as reserved.

cancelSeats():

Allows users to cancel bookings for specific seats and marks them as available again.

viewAvailableSeats():

Simply calls displaySeats() to show available seats.

authenticateAdmin():

Checks if the entered password matches a predefined password (in this case, "admin123").

**Potential Improvements**

Input Validation:

Currently, there is minimal validation for user inputs. Adding checks to ensure valid seat numbers and handling invalid inputs more gracefully could improve robustness.

Dynamic Seat Allocation:

Currently, the seating arrangement is static. Implementing dynamic seat allocation or saving the seat state to a file would be useful for real-world applications.

Admin Authentication:

Password handling should be improved for security. Instead of hardcoding passwords, consider using a more secure method.

**Error Handling:**

More comprehensive error handling could be added, particularly for file operations or invalid user inputs.
